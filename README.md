  Model trained using NumPy â€” no scikit-learn or external ML libraries used.

- ðŸ“Š **Prediction Confidence & Feature Importance**  
  Get a clear probability (%) of potability and understand which features influenced the result most.

- ðŸ’¡ **Actionable Suggestions**  
  If the sample is unsafe, the app suggests how to improve it (e.g., increase pH, reduce solids).
